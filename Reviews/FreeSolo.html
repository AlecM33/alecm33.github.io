            <p>Free Solo is exhilarating, and Alex Honnold’s historic climb is as intense and anxiety-inducing as any blockbuster climax. In fact, Free Solo is at a higher echelon because the stakes are real – one slip of the finger or foot and Alex is no more, and everyone he cares about loses him forever. The documentary does not lose sight of these risks and the impact of Alex’s profession on himself and those around him – even in the wake of his magnificent ascents.
                The film centers on Alex’s long-gestating goal of free solo climbing Yosemite’s infamous El Capitan – an imposing three-thousand foot granite cliff-face. Free solo climbing involves no ropes, harnesses, or other equipment. The climber is relying completely on skill and a bag of chalk. It’s downright unbelievable to watch. The film is beautifully shot, balancing wide sequences of grandiose cliffs with intimate displays of Alex’s climbing prowess. True to documentary format, we get insightful, honest, and often emotional commentary from Alex’s friends, family, and peers.
                “Why?” is the obvious question here. Of course, the profound danger of this method of climbing means that there is no shortage of prominent free soloists falling to their deaths, including a close friend of Alex. The simplicity and speed of a harnessless climb is liberating, to be sure, but it does not justify putting one’s life repeatedly in danger. For Honnold, it least, his love for the sport trumps the desire for safety, even when considering the worry of his friends and girlfriend. Alex clearly has an intense passion for perfection – for honing his skills and for throwing his full concentration into a successful climb. He says about as much. I found his pursuit of El Capitan borderline obsessive. He journaled constantly about every pitch and every notable hold. He was desperate to bounce back as quickly as possible from a sprain, going so far as to scale an indoor wall in his ankle boot.
                As I stated, Free Solo is not lost on the impact this has on Alex’s social circle. The film is not one extended thrill ride. It is patient and deliberate. We follow Alex for a long time, gaining insights into his childhood, his climbing career, his friends, his romantic relationships, and even his brain. His relationship with his current girlfriend, Sanni, is one of the most fascinating aspects of the documentary. Sanni, Alex’s strong and honest companion, is remarkably supportive of Alex’s climbing. Alex has had problems with relationships due to his career. Most of the women were understandably uncomfortable caring about someone who risks their life as a day-to-day excursion. This raised an interesting ethical dilemma for me. Is Alex obligated to tone down his climbing in consideration of those he cares about? El Capitan is another beast entirely, and it is difficult for Sanni to come to terms with the climb, and for Alex’s friends to watch and support his journey.
                This documentary, to me, is a must-see. It is an often thoughtful exploration into the human condition, in addition to an inspiring display of an incredible physical feat.
