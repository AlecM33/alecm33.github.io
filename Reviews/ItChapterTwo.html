                    "Everything's a lot tougher when it's for real. That's when you choke. When it's for real." – Stan Uris
                </p>
                <p id="review">
                    This is a quote from the novel. Stanley uttered this to his wife, Patty. Only forty pages in, the
                    line is dense foreshadowing. The ensuing thousand-page odyssey serves to illustrate the massive,
                    repressed reservoir of traumatic memories that swim in the depths of Stan’s brain. Ironically,
                    this was Stanley’s explanation for why contestants on <i>Family Feud</i> often couldn’t come up with
                    seemingly easy answers: an entire monster-ridden saga of his childhood, compressed and sharpened into
                    a needlepoint, used to pencil in an observation about game show television.<br><br>Stanley, like the other
                    Losers, is a character built over long, sometimes even over-written chapters. King certainly takes
                    his time delving into the psyches of his creations, giving us their thoughts and their thoughts about
                    their thoughts. While tedious at times, what it does do is connect us with the character and the
                    things that then befall them. If the appropriate foundation is not built, the result can be wooden
                    or even completely jarring (take, for example, Dany’s descent into madness in the last season of
                    <i>Game of Thrones</i>).<br><br>Unfortunately, the <i>It</i> films don’t have a thousand pages to work with.
                    Thus, writers had to stuff two massive timelines (young Losers and adult Losers) into two films,
                    the latter of which featured a nearly three-hour runtime. The first film felt particularly skin-deep.
                    The characters seemed completely defined by their immediately-apparent qualities: Eddie’s hypochondriasis,
                    Richie’s lack of a vocal filter. The second film does better on this front, partly due to the runtime.
                    It revels in flashbacks, seeking to connect the older and younger versions of the Losers. It’s more
                    dialogue-driven. I enjoyed the flashbacks, which often featured clever and seamless transitions
                    (credit to Andrés Muschietti). However, it feels like it’s trying to do a lot of heavy-lifting to
                    make up for the lack of character development in the first film.<br><br>The fundamental issue here is that <i>It</i>
                    is an absolute monster of a book to adapt to film. There’s a dizzying amount of content to choose
                    from, and a bonkers ending that would give any script-writer a headache. The surreal, chameleon-like
                    villain Pennywise lives best in the imaginations of the readers. Any attempt to make him tangible
                    will fall short in some regard. Granted, Tim Curry and Bill Skarsgård pour their soul into their
                    personas of the evil clown. Yet in adapting him to the screen, the viewer loses some of that fear of
                    the unknown. The relationship between a reader and their mind’s eye, in my view, is more immediate
                    than that between the viewer and the screen. With horror, bridging the gap between the imagination
                    and the real world sometimes dulls the blade, especially considering some of the choices that the <i>It</i>
                    films make.<br><br><i>It: Chapter Two</i> is a horror film. But, with the exception of some clever scares
                    and well-constructed setpieces, it doesn’t feel very scary. The culprits are ones we fault horror
                    films for time and time again: an over-reliance on predictable jump scares (synchronized with blasts
                    of music), clichéd haunted house meandering, and ill-fitting CGI. There are some issues which are
                    more unique to this film. Tone is one – at times, even during the most climactic moments, the film
                    shifts into outright comedy mode. Furthermore, this film falters as the first film did, in that it
                    doesn’t give Skarsgård quite enough room to operate. The film never waits long before drenching the
                    actor in face-manipulating CGI that is often more awkward than unsettling.<br><br>Everything aside, the
                    film is still a commendable adaptation. It’s faithful. The kids offer up another round of great
                    performances, and the parallels between them and their adult counterparts are wonderful. It’s great
                    to think of the work that the adult actors had to put in to provide continuity between the two
                    timelines, which I assume included extensive consultation with the child actors. As I mentioned
                    before, there are some particularly strong setpieces. Muschietti makes good use of the entire width
                    of the frame, and loves to use the characters’ fears, backgrounds, and relationships to construct
                    unique scares for them. Stephen King himself is a fan, and considering King’s strong opinions on
                    certain adaptations of his work, that’s certainly a win. Since I’ve read the novel, I had to try
                    and separate myself from all I already know about the characters, lest it trick me into thinking
                    the film had more characterization than it actually did. One wonders how difficult this would be for King.
