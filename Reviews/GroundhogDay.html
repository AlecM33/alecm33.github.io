                <p id="review"> At the time of this review, I have seen this film twenty-two times. <br><br>“Wow, he
                    must really like that film. Probably watches it a couple times a year,” you think. <br><br>Think
                    again! <br><br>Two times now, along with several friends, I’ve spent twenty-four hours at the local
                    Gateway Film Center for their annual Groundhog Day Marathon, where you watch the film twelve times
                    (most recently ten, for longer breaks) from two p.m. Saturday to two p.m. Sunday. As compensation,
                    you receive twenty-four free movie passes to use for the next year. As one would assume, it’s just
                    awful. There’s comradery, of course. The rowdy theater bonds over a swath of running gags and
                    recurring favorite scenes. And the regret, at least for me, fades quickly. Having the passes is
                    great, too. This is perhaps what lulled to sleep the decision-making parts of my brain when I
                    decided to come back for seconds. <br><br>At this point, I know the film to a disturbing extent. I
                    can mentally journey scene-by-scene in my head, at least for some time after. I know the inflection
                    and timing of a large portion of the script. <br><br>None of this guarantees a good review. None of
                    this forces you to respect or agree with what I have to say. Much like how a degree in
                    computer science doesn’t guarantee that this site looks good. In fact, seeing the film this many
                    consecutive times in such a stressful environment probably introduces its own set of biases.<br><br>
                    What I’m saying is, the ingredients for a good review are certainly here. Now it’s my job to use this
                    vast knowledge – more knowledge than anyone should ever have about any film – to deliver a critical
                    tour de force. With that, onward!<br><br> The film is pretty good. <br><br>The End*<br><br>* <i>I
                        don't plan to write joke reviews. But this one had to be.</i>
