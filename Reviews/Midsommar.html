                    It’s certainly not safe, lightly-salted horror. It’s probably not the horror you’d pick as the capstone to a nice, romantic
                    outing with a significant other. Sometimes, it’s simply complete lunacy. But it’s horror. And it’s got
                    a beautiful, unforgettable personality.

                    I left the theater after seeing <i>Midsommar</i> in a haze. For me, one mark of a unique film is my difficulty
                    in quickly and decisively analyzing it. How did I feel about it? What was it trying to tell me? This
                    film doesn’t yield easy answers to these questions. Did I like it? Yes. That one’s easy. I felt fear,
                    shock, sadness, discomfort – I even felt the urge to laugh uncontrollably. All these emotions packed
                    into one dizzyingly psychedelic picture result in nothing other than an enjoyable ride.<br><br> Ari Aster is
                    solidifying himself as one of the most intriguing horror directors today. He has a good knowledge of
                    what it takes for something to be truly horrifying. Not cheap jump scares tied to a predictable
                    symphonic blast, and not yet another slow, blindly curious walk through a haunted house (I’m looking
                    at you, James Wan). What makes something horrifying is its ability to truly subvert expectations,
                    and take the mind to a place it fully did not expect--or want--to go. <i>Midsommar</i> reminded me heavily of Guadagnino’s
                    <i>Suspiria</i>, in that it relies heavily on beautifully novel and often terrifying imagery to
                    evoke fear and discomfort. There’s a complete disregard for what should and shouldn’t be shown on
                    the screen. It’s complete artistic free-roaming.<br><br>The place that <i>Midsommar</i> roams to is gorgeous.
                    It’s a commune in the Swedish countryside, and it’s a setting for a horror film unlike any other.
                    The film happens almost entirely in the daytime. The frame is dominated by simple yet intricately
                    decorated architecture, and motifs of pure white and flowers. It’s a bold and welcome juxtaposition.
                    The set and costume design is beautifully colorful and baroque. The shots are often symmetrical and
                    encompassing, with slow sweeping pans balanced with jarring cuts. There isn’t a lot of obvious CGI,
                    save for drug-induced psychedelia. On a technical level, the film is a marvel to look at. <br><br> Family
                    struck me as a central theme. In this way, and in other ways, the film parallels <i>Hereditary</i>. It
                    explores what family means beyond a simple blood relation. Empathy, support through loss, unconditional
                    love – these are things which we believe constitute true care. When the movie’s central relationship
                    goes sour, we see that while it was strong and serene on the surface, the foundation wasn’t what it
                    seemed – much like the seemingly pure and idyllic setting. Further, if a sense of community grows
                    too strong, and ancestral tradition entrenches itself to the point of unquestionable loyalty, we see
                    the maddening and grotesque effects this can have on us all. <br><br>That said, I’m not madly in love with
                    the film. There’s so much to like about it – the set design, the imagery, the face-melting score – but
                    there are things which I believe take away from it. Chief among these is the absolute derailment of
                    the third act. I was confronted with nudity, gore, and nonsensical derangement that gave my friends
                    and I no choice but to laugh in disbelief. Like I said previously, laughter in a horror film doesn’t
                    dry up my enjoyment, but it certainly doesn’t seem right for me to be laughing. Though there are jokes,
                    the film is by no means a comedy. By my account, the scenes which evoked laughter were certainly meant
                    to be taken seriously. This blunted the razor’s edge that I believe Ari Aster wants his films to have.
                    These scenes may very well serve his purpose in depicting true madness, but to me they are just needless
                    excess. To their credit, they don’t feel so out of place in the setting that the movie establishes.
                    <br><br>In the end, I emphasize that this is a unique voice in horror. It’s not easy viewing, and that’s how
                    the best of the genre should be. So, in that regard, I fully endorse seeing it. It’s certainly not
                    safe, lightly-salted horror. It’s probably not the horror you’d pick as the capstone to a nice, romantic
                    outing with a significant other. Sometimes, it’s simply complete lunacy. But it’s horror. And it’s got
                    a beautiful, unforgettable personality.
