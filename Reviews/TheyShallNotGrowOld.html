                    <span style="font-style: normal">They Shall Not Grow Old</span> tells a fascinating and horrifying
                    story of a British soldier on the Western Front. In a story told with sensitivity and grace, viewers
                    are confronted with a beautifully-restored portrait of ordinary young men thrown into a mess of
                    suffering that only they can understand.

                <p id="review">Most people have some idea in their head about what World War I was like – even if it’s a
                    vague one. They know that it was a grinding, stalemated affair characterized by brutal trench
                    warfare. They know of shells, of mustard gas, and of trench foot. Perhaps they were assigned to read
                    <i>All Quiet On the Western Front</i>, as I was. Regardless of how one’s mental image was constructed,
                    nothing can prepare you for seeing it with your own eyes. Make no mistake – Remarque’s novel is an
                    astounding and essential piece of literature. All the same, any flaws or romanticism in your idea of
                    the First World War are brutally course-corrected once the footage is before your eyes, in a way
                    that the printed medium simply cannot touch. <br><br><i>They Shall Not Grow Old</i> opens modestly. Using
                    unaltered footage, we hear what are clearly aged veterans talking about why they joined up, what
                    their first feelings about the war were, and much more. There’s a curious mental motif of simplistic
                    obligation – “I joined the army because we were going to war, and that’s what I had to do.” There
                    were no second thoughts. You went and joined up with your mates, clear-eyed and gung-ho. It’s an
                    admirable sense of patriotism, duty, and—with the knowledge of what they were getting
                    into—unfettered innocence. <br><br>The film’s format parallels the soldiers’ descent into the
                    hellfire of the trenches. This is, without a doubt, the supreme accomplishment of this film.
                    Suddenly, the grainy, jittery film expands to fill the whole screen, and color washes over the
                    frame. It’s restoration that is nothing short of magical. The source of the narrative, however,
                    never changes. We hear only the words of the veterans, compiled from archived interviews from the
                    seventies. I, and Peter Jackson, felt that this was the best choice. Jackson wanted no contamination
                    of the narrative, which, as he explains in an after-credits special, influenced not just the
                    narration, but the visuals and soundtrack as well. The music is not overdone, so as to avoid
                    injecting artificial emotion. During an intense description of a trench raid, Jackson is careful to
                    select drawings that avoid propagandistic depictions of the British and the Germans. As a result,
                    the narrative is true to the soldier’s words. <br><br>What a narrative it is. I couldn’t help but
                    gasp and shake my head at the conditions of the war, and at how stoically the soldiers handled it.
                    The respect and pity that the veterans expressed for the Germans highlighted how mutually pointless
                    the soldiers found the war to be. They knew that their enemy, like them, were simply duty-bound
                    civilians – farmers, waiters, butchers. <br><br>You would hope that, in their vulnerable and
                    shell-shocked state, that these veterans would be welcomed back to society with warmth and care. But
                    it was not to be. As the veterans describe, there was mass unemployment and, in many cases, a lack
                    of understanding from those at home about how horrific the experience on the front actually was.
                    It’s a tragedy of aching proportions. <br><br>Peter Jackson was commissioned for this film, and he
                    delivered in the best way. Bravo to everyone involved in its making.
